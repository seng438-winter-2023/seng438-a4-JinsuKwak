# Introduction

In this assignment, students were required to learn two important aspects of testing: Mutation testing ang GUI testing on a chosen website. In the mutation testing part of the assignment, it was espected from students to learn how to inject mutation faults in a Java code-base using a mutation testing tool called PIT Mutations. We had to interpret the reported mutation scores and the mutants that were killed and that survived to design new test cases to improve the overall quality of the test suite. In the second part of the assignment, we tested a chosen website using a common way of GUI test automation, record and replay. We learned how to use a very well-known tool for web interface testing (Selenium) and compared it with another alternative.

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

Equivalent mutants distort the accuracy of mutation scores. The presence of equivalent mutants makes the test suite's quality look lower than it actually is, when in fact it doesn't since no tests can actually detect them.


# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

Mutatation testing is needed because it tells us the quality of our test suite and how good it is at catching bugs.

Advantages of Mutation Testing

     -Mutation Testing is automated 
     
     -Mutation Testing gives us the mutation score, which tells us when to stop testing and which test suite's quality is better

Disadvantages of Mutation Testing

     -Mutation Testing is time consuming
     
     -The presence of equivalent mutants (there tends to be a lot of equivalent mutants in SUTs, and as we know, equivalent mutants cannot be killed)



# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process

| Functionality | Input Sequence | Expected Ouput | Assertions |
| --------------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| Search for a product | Click on search bar, type "Tent", click on search button, click on product | Shows product title and image | Assert that product title and image are there|
| Search for a warehouse | Click on locations link, type "Calgary", click on find button, click on a warehouse | Shows warehouse title, description, and map | Assert that warehouse title and map image are there |
 

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

In Selenium, the assertions are checkpoints that are used to make sure that the SUT is working as intended. For example, you can assert whether the link on a web page is correct or not. When running a test case, if the condition of the assertion is not met, the test will immediately fail.


# How did you test each functionaity with different test data

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix

Advantages of Selenium:

    -It is supported across multiple operating systems and browsers


Disadvantages of Selenium:

    -Can only test web applications


Advantages of Sikulix:

    -Can automate Flash objects
    
    -Can automate desktop applications

Disadvantages of Sikulix:

    -It has issues with cross-browser testing


# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

For the GUI Testing, we made a list of possible functionalities that our chosen website would have and put our names beside the functionalities and got that done

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Some difficulties encountered in this assignment is firstly, running the PIT mutations on our computers. It took very long to execute the mutation tests and we did not know what the printed code on the console meant. But after some asking around and help with the TA's, we were able to run the PIT mutations on our laptops and were able to generate the reports of the killed and survived mutants are well as the mutation coverage percentage for each class. Another difficulty we faced was during the GUI testing. Just trying to set up the Selenium IDE took some time since we were not familiar with it. But we also had some difficulty understanding how to do the verification points on the Selenium IDE for our tests but we researched and asked with our peers and were able to solve our issues. 

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself

This assignment took a long time for us to understand what exactly needs to be done. It was also hard because the PIT Mutations took a very long time to execute and compile. Overall, the assignment was effective in creating tasks that demonstrated Mutation and GUI testing.
